*   **21:30 The LeBroN stack: LevelDB + Browserify + Npm**  
    by [Julian Gruber](/speakers.html#juliang)
    
    LeBroN is a triumvirate of technologies that lets you create applications for the web in a very lightweight and lean manner. 
    Covering data storage, realtime updates, packaging and package management, you can quickly create applications that do a lot. 
    I'll live code a real time chat (or something like that),
    composing many small parts and show casing the simplicity and effectiveness of the abstractions at hand.
