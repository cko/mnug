On July 30, 2015 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/224164267/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On July 30, 2015 we have the following schedule:


*   **19:00: Beer & Pizza**  
    sponsored by [TNG Technology Consulting](http://www.tngtech.com)
    
*   **20:00: Ripple-Lib: Open Source Banking in Javascript**  
    by [Martin Kreidenweis](/speakers.html#martink) and [Konstantin Knauf](/speakers.html#konstantink)
  
    In our talk we will give an introduction to the Ripple payment system. Ripple
    is an open source, real-time, cross-currency network, based on a
    distributed database. We will show how to connect to the Ripple network and
    how to move money around in a matter of seconds, just with a few lines of Javascript.

    To give you an idea of what is possible with Ripple, we will also introduce a
    small web application we built during a Hackathon in June. Our app,
    [Blitzpay](http://www.blitzpay.biz), won the special prize of the Bavarian
    Ministry of Economic Affairs and Media, Energy and Technology for highest
    economic impact. In terms of technology· webapp Blitzpay consists of
    a ReactJS fronted backed by node.js. [Video](https://youtu.be/Vieg-WzWtLc)
  
*   **20:45: Message Queues with NSQ - The infrastructural glue**  
    by [Julian Gruber](/speakers.html#juliang)
   
    Queue systems are a helpful tool for improving on your infrastructure’s
    scalability, failure tolerance and decoupling. I’ll be demonstrating the
    most important concepts and approaches, live coding at the example of
    Bitly’s NSQ. Afterwards you will be able to either dive deeper into NSQ or
    use your new foundations to evaluate other queue systems. [Video](https://youtu.be/xhNapGc6SsU)
