**Attention! We meet at a new location. Einstein Kultur**

### What?

On April 21, 2016 we have the following schedule:


*   **18:30: Door open**  
  
*   **19:00: Break with Beer & Food**  
    sponsored by [TNG Technology Consulting](http://www.tngtech.com)
  
*   **20:00: From express to koa - http frameworks**
    by [Robert Prediger](/speakers.html#robertp)

    This session will show you a few http frameworks, mainly from express to
    koa. How they work, a few examples with source code, my personal experiences
    with pros and cons to maybe make your decision a bit easier.
  
*   **20:45: How we automated API growth with microservices**  
    by [Jesús Darío Rivera](/speakers.html#jesusr)
  
    During the talk we are going to describe the system from outside to inside.
    This is yet another approach for microservices, that is more about
    implementation than configuration. [Video](https://youtu.be/CTIamTSaCGA)
  
*   **21:30: Hyperdrive - a p2p file sharing network**  
    by [Mathias Buus Madsen](/speakers.html#mathiasb)
  
    [Hyperdrive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive) is a new project
    that is best described as a p2p open source dropbox build in javascript.
    It combines a variety of interesting algorithms to support features such
    as, delta updates, file deduplication and is completely decentralized with
    no single points of failures. This talk will be a brief introduction to how
    it works and live demos showcasing some the applications you can use this for.
