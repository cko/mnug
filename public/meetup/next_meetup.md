### What?

On December 10, 2015 we have the following schedule:


*   **18:00: Implementing Websockets in Nodejs**  
    by [Bodo Kaiser](/speakers.html#bodok)
  
    Overview and discussion of implementation details of the Websockets protocol with live coding in between.
  
*   **18:45: Node.js PaaS**  
    by [Jonas Woerlein]()
  
    This talk provides an overview of publicly available Platform as a Service
    offerings to easily deploy Node.js applications to the cloud. Selected ones are
    described in detail and I will demo the deployment of a small application to
    the platform of my choice.  The starting point of this talk was my struggle to
    find a good provider where I could host a small side project of mine
    permanently at no cost. Thus, the talk focuses on features relevant for
    development and keeps operations out of scope.

*   **19:15: Beer & Pizza**  
    sponsored by [TNG Technology Consulting](http://www.tngtech.com)
  
*   **20:00: IoT Chess**

*   **21:45: Hyperdrive - a p2p file sharing network**  
    by [Mathias Buus Madsen](/speakers.html#mathiasb)
  
    [Hyperdrive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive) is a new project
    that is best described as a p2p open source dropbox build in javascript.
    It combines a variety of interesting algorithms to support features such
    as, delta updates, file deduplication and is completely decentralized with
    no single points of failures. This talk will be a brief introduction to how
    it works and live demos showcasing some the applications you can use this for.
