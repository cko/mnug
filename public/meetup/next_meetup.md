# Meetup: December 10, 2015

On December 10, 2015 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/227182056/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

**Attention! We start already at 6pm.**

### What?

On December 10, 2015 we have the following schedule:


*   **17:30: Door open**  
  
*   **18:00: Implementing Websockets in Nodejs**  
    by [Bodo Kaiser](/speakers.html#bodok)
  
    Overview and discussion of implementation details of the Websockets protocol with live coding in between.
  
*   **18:45: Node.js PaaS**  
    by [Jonas Woerlein]()
  
    This talk provides an overview of publicly available Platform as a Service
    offerings to easily deploy Node.js applications to the cloud. Selected ones are
    described in detail and I will demo the deployment of a small application to
    the platform of my choice.  The starting point of this talk was my struggle to
    find a good provider where I could host a small side project of mine
    permanently at no cost. Thus, the talk focuses on features relevant for
    development and keeps operations out of scope.

*   **19:15: Break with Beer & Food**  
    sponsored by [TNG Technology Consulting](http://www.tngtech.com)
  
*   **20:00: IoT Chess**  
    by [Lars Gregori](/speakers.html#larsg)
  
    TBD
  
*   **20:25: How we automated API growth with microservices**  
    by [Jesús Darío Rivera](/speakers.html#jesusr)
  
    To allow communication for vendor independant devices is hard. A single API
    may not work for many resources and so for a developer is imposible to
    create apps cross-target. This refers to an app, that independently of the
    hardware that is running on, has another device or resource as a target,
    that may have an unknown API.

    To solve this problem in Netbeast we have created both an API and an API
    engine. The API engine is a structure that allows an API to be extended
    with microservices, that declare themselves as part of a major application
    and run on a different process. The API itself is the interface that the
    engine provides to developers to make use of the mesh of microservices that
    are behind.

    This structure runs like a whole thing. Whenever an error comes primitives
    might be dispatched from different microservices and those may implement
    different capabilities and remain secret not only for the user, but for the
    developer that make use of them. This is a flexible way to create massive
    applications that evolve with time, like building blocks for software.

    During the talk we are going to describe the system from outside to inside.
    This is yet another approach for microservices, that is more about
    implementation than configuration.

  
*   **21:00: Hyperdrive - a p2p file sharing network**  
    by [Mathias Buus Madsen](/speakers.html#mathiasb)
  
    [Hyperdrive](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperdrive) is a new project
    that is best described as a p2p open source dropbox build in javascript.
    It combines a variety of interesting algorithms to support features such
    as, delta updates, file deduplication and is completely decentralized with
    no single points of failures. This talk will be a brief introduction to how
    it works and live demos showcasing some the applications you can use this for.
  
*   **22:45: Close down of MNUG meetup**
