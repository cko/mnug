### What?

On April 21, 2016 we have the following schedule:


*   **18:45: Door open**  
  
*   **19:00: Start with Beer & Food**  
    sponsored by [TNG Technology Consulting](http://www.tngtech.com)

*   **20:00: The past, present and future of ECMAScript modules**  
    by [Alexander Zeilmann](/speakers.html#alexz)
  
    Now, that we have the new and shiny ECMAScript module system it is a
    good time to look back on the techniques we used as a replacement for a
    native module system.
    What advantages and disadvantages they had and what will probably happen
    to them now.
    We will look into a few awesome things, you can already do with
    ECMAScript modules and a few things which are not yet possible, but
    hopefully are coming in the future.
  
*   **20:45: From express to koa - http frameworks**  
    by [Robert Prediger](/speakers.html#robertp)

    This session will show you a few http frameworks, mainly from express to
    koa. How they work, a few examples with source code, my personal experiences
    with pros and cons to maybe make your decision a bit easier.
  
*   **21:30: Going serverless - an overview**  
    by [Alexander Reelsen](/speakers.html#alexr)
  
    Since the introduction of AWS lambda and its google/azure counterparts
    serverless is the new buzzword for application architectures, that scale
    and are low maintenance. Time to check out the node ecosystem and how node
    can help to write applications that are serverless. This talk gives a quick
    overview what serverless means (and what it doesnt), its core concepts, how
    this changes application development, the different tools to support
    developers and hopefully a live demo!

*   **22:45: Close down of MNUG meetup**  
    by all node hackers

### When?
 
Talks starting at 8:00pm. Admission with beer & pizza from 7pm.
