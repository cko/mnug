### What?

On 4th December 2014 we have the following schedule:


*   **19:00: Beer & Pizza**

*   **20:00 Kickstarting node.js projects with Yeoman**  
    by [Patrick Bürgin](/speakers.html#patrickb)
    
    Scaffolding can be a great way to enable developers quickly in a way consistent with best practices employed by the community or your organization. 
    [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) is a proven scaffolding tool for webapps that has been around since 2012 and now sports more than 6000 stars on GitHub. 
    Even though its original focus used to be on supporting front-end development, 
    it now features a considerable number of Node.js-related generators worth exploring. 
    This talk will give a quick overview on the topic of scaffolding, explain what Yeoman is all about and show you how to make the best use of it.
