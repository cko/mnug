# About

The Munich Node.JS User Group was founded with the idea of an open, 
munich based community of server-side JavaScript developers in mind. 

Therefore we (Aron Homberg, Christine Koppelt, Christoph Stock, Robert Kuzelj und Stefan Zaunseder) founded the Munich Node.JS User Group (MNUG) in November 2011.
